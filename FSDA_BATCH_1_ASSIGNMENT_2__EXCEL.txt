1. What does the dollar($) sign do?

Answer:-- A dollar sign can use a US currency format, and one more use is
 indicating absolute cell references in formulas.


2. How to Change the Reference from Relative to Absolute (or Mixed)? 

Answer:-- Relative reference is when you drag the formula to another cell, it will change 
the respective cell location as relative like at D4= B4 * C4 and when I drag the same 
formula to D5 then the formula is like D5= B5 * C5 by itself.
If you want to maintain the original cell reference when you copy it, make the cell 
reference absolute by preceding the columns and row with a $ sign
D4= $B$4 * $C$4,
When you copy this formula from D4 to D5, the formula stays exactly the same
Less often, if you want to mix absolute and relative cell references by preceding either 
the column or the row value with a $ sign- which fixes either the column or the row 
(B$4 or $C4)
While writing formula F4 will help to change between related to absolute to mixed.
