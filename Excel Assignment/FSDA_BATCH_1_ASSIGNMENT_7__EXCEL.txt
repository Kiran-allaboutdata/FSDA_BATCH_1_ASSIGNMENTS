Q. Using Insert Function, give examples of any function available in the
 different dropdowns present in the function library ? 
 
-->
.AutoSum-In Microsoft Excel, the AutoSum feature allows you to quickly sum a range of cells by selecting a range 
of cells and then clicking the AutoSum button in the Home tab of the ribbon.

  * To use AutoSum:
1. Select the cell below the range of cells that you want to sum. For example, if you want to sum cells A1 
through A5, select cell A6.
2. Click the AutoSum button in the Home tab of the ribbon. It looks like a Greek sigma symbol (Î£).
3. Excel will automatically detect the range of cells that you want to sum and enter a formula in the 
selected cell to add them up.
4. Press Enter to complete the formula and see the result of the sum.

	You can also use AutoSum to sum other functions, such as average, min, or max. To do this, select the 
cells that you want to sum and then click the dropdown arrow on the AutoSum button. Choose the 
function that you want to use from the list.

	If Excel does not select the range of cells that you want to sum, you can manually select the range 
before clicking the AutoSum button. Alternatively, you can type the formula manually by using the 
SUM function. For example, to sum cells A1 through A5, you can type "=SUM(A1:A5)" in the selected 
cell.

Q. What is AutoFit and why do we use it?

-->AutoFit is a feature in Microsoft Excel that allows you to automatically adjust the width or height of a 
cell or a range of cells to fit the contents of the cell or range. The feature is useful when you have data 
in a cell or range of cells that is too large to be displayed in the current width or height of the cells, or 
when you want to adjust the size of the cells to better fit the data they contain.
There are several ways to use AutoFit in Excel:
To adjust the width of a cell or range of cells to fit the contents, select the cell or range, and then click 
the "Format" tab in the ribbon. In the "Format" tab, click the "AutoFit Column Width" button. This will 
adjust the width of the cells to fit the contents of the cells.
To adjust the height of a cell or range of cells to fit the contents, select the cell or range, and then click 
the "Format" tab in the ribbon. In the "Format" tab, click the "AutoFit Row Height" button. This will 
adjust the height of the cells to fit the contents of the cells.
To adjust the width and height of a cell or range of cells to fit the contents, select the cell or range, 
and then right-click on the selection and choose "Format Cells" from the context menu. In the "Format 
Cells" dialog box, click the "Alignment" tab, and then check the "Wrap text" checkbox. This will wrap 
the text in the cells and adjust the width and height of the cells to fit the contents.
